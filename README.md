# grunt-init-rendr-react

> Create a [Rendr](https://github.com/airbnb/rendr) + [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) project with [grunt-init][], including unit tests. Based on [Pete Hunt's template](https://github.com/petehunt/rendr-react-template)

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:stevoland/grunt-init-rendr.git ~/.grunt-init/rendr-react
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init rendr-react
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
